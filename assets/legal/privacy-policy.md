Blow-Grid Privacy Policy

Scope and Acceptance  
This Privacy Policy describes how Blow-Grid (the "App") collects, uses, discloses, retains, and protects information when you access or use the App. By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Policy.

Definitions  
1. "Personal Information" means information that identifies or can reasonably be linked to an identifiable individual (for example, name, email, or phone number).  
2. "Route Data" means records stored in the App, such as assigned addresses, stops, and task statuses.  
3. "Service Providers" are trusted third parties that host, process, transmit, store, or otherwise handle data strictly on our behalf to deliver the App.

Information We Process  
1. Account Details: name or alias, email address or phone number, workspace or company, and role (admin, driver, or developer).  
2. Credentials: hashed passwords (never stored in plain text) and session tokens.  
3. Route Data: addresses or stops assigned to you, any admin-supplied lists, and progress updates; we may normalize, deduplicate, or geocode addresses to operate the service.  
4. Activity and Diagnostics: login timestamps ("last active"), error codes, device or OS version, installation identifiers, and basic usage needed to operate and troubleshoot the App. If we add crash/analytics tooling, it is limited to operating and improving the App.  
5. Location: when you grant foreground device location permission, we read your current GPS position to show your dot on the map. This location is used in-session and is not stored or sent to our servers for tracking.  
6. Billing Flow Metadata: when you start a subscription checkout on the web, we exchange customer and workspace identifiers with our payment processor; payment card data is collected and stored by the processor (not by us).  
If we handle push notifications, we store the device token only to deliver messages. We do not run advertising or cross-app tracking.

Purposes of Processing  
We handle information to create and manage accounts, authenticate access, display and synchronize assigned stops, support administrators, secure the App, prevent abuse (including rate limits and deduplication), diagnose issues, fulfill subscription billing via the web, and satisfy legal requirements.

Legal or Contractual Basis  
Processing is necessary to perform agreements with users, to pursue our legitimate interests in delivering and safeguarding the App, and to meet applicable legal obligations.

Disclosures to Service Providers  
1. Information may be shared with Service Providers solely to operate the App, including but not limited to database and API platforms, hosting or CDN services, build and delivery services, map and geocoding providers, payment processors, and diagnostic services.  
2. Service Providers follow our instructions, must protect confidentiality, and cannot use data for their own purposes.

International Processing  
Primary hosting occurs in Canada. Some processing may take place in the United States via Service Providers, with appropriate safeguards applied where required.

Retention  
1. Account, credential, and Route Data are kept until the account is deleted by you or an administrator.  
2. Security and activity logs (including last-active timestamps) are retained for up to 30 days before deletion, unless a longer period is required by law or to resolve an active issue.  
3. Backups are purged on the next scheduled cycle (within 30 days) after an account is deleted.

Your Controls and Rights  
1. You can delete your account and data in-app; password re-entry confirms identity. When deletion is confirmed, profile data, credentials, tokens, assignments, and related history are removed from active systems and from backups on the next purge cycle.  
2. You may access or update account details in the App or by submitting a verified request through the contact information below.  
3. iOS users manage billing on the web; no in-app purchases are processed in the iOS companion.

Security  
We apply administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the data handled, including password hashing, encrypted transport (HTTPS/TLS), and access controls such as role-based restrictions. No system is entirely secure, but we monitor and improve protections.

Children  
The App is intended for general use and is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has used the App, notify us and we will remove the data.

Changes  
We may revise this Policy to reflect operational, legal, or regulatory updates. Material updates will be communicated through reasonable notice, and the "Effective" date will indicate the current version.

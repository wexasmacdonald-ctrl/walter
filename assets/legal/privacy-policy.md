Blow-Pin Privacy Policy
Scope and Acceptance
1. This Privacy Policy describes how Blow-Pin (the “App”) collects, uses, discloses, retains, and protects information when you access or use the App.
2. By using the App, you acknowledge that you have read and understood this Policy.

Definitions
1. “Personal Information” means information that identifies or can reasonably be linked to an identifiable individual (for example, name, email, or phone number).
2. “Route Data” means records stored in the App, such as assigned addresses, stops, and task statuses.
3. “Service Providers” are trusted third parties that host, process, transmit, store, or otherwise handle data strictly on our behalf to deliver the App.

Information We Process
1. Account Details: name or alias, email address or phone number, and role (admin or driver).
2. Credentials: hashed passwords (never stored in plain text) and session tokens.
3. Route Data: addresses or stops assigned to you and your progress updates.
4. Diagnostics: limited technical details (login timestamps, error codes, device or OS version, installation identifiers) required to operate and troubleshoot the App.
We do not collect your precise GPS location, and we do not run advertising or cross-app tracking.

Purposes of Processing
We handle information only to create and manage accounts, authenticate access, display and synchronize assigned stops, provide support, secure the App, prevent abuse, diagnose issues, and satisfy legal requirements.

Legal or Contractual Basis
Processing is necessary to perform agreements with users, to pursue our legitimate interests in delivering and safeguarding the App, and to meet applicable legal obligations.

Disclosures to Service Providers
1. Information may be shared with Service Providers solely to operate the App, including database and API platforms, hosting or CDN services, map and geocoding providers, and build, delivery, or diagnostic services.
2. Service Providers follow our instructions, must protect confidentiality, and cannot use data for their own purposes.

International Processing
Primary hosting occurs in Canada. Some processing may take place in the United States via Service Providers, with appropriate safeguards applied where required.

Retention
1. Account, credential, and Route Data are kept until the account is deleted by you or an administrator.
2. Security logs are retained for up to 30 days before deletion.
3. Backups are purged on the next scheduled cycle (within 30 days) after an account is deleted.

Your Controls and Rights
1. You can delete your account and data in-app; password re-entry confirms identity. When deletion is confirmed, profile data, credentials, tokens, assignments, and related history are permanently removed.
2. You may access or update account details in the App or by submitting a verified request through the contact information below.

Security
We apply administrative, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the data handled, including password hashing, encrypted transport (HTTPS or TLS), and access controls such as row-level restrictions. No system is entirely secure, but we continuously monitor and improve protections.

Children
The App is intended for general use and is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has used the App, notify us and we will remove the data.

Changes
We may revise this Policy to reflect operational, legal, or regulatory updates. Material updates will be communicated through reasonable notice, and the “Effective” date will indicate the current version.

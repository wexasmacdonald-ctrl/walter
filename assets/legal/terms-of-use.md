Blow-Pin Terms of Use

Acceptance  
Installing, accessing, or using Blow-Pin (the "App") means you agree to these Terms of Use. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

Eligibility  
The App may be used by individuals who receive an account invite. You must comply with these Terms and applicable laws. The App is not directed to children under 13.

Accounts and Security  
You are responsible for safeguarding your credentials and for activity under your account. Provide accurate information and keep it up to date. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or threaten the App or its users. Developer-only tools (for example, impersonation or account removal) are restricted to authorized developer roles.

License  
We grant a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the App for your personal or business use. All other rights are reserved.

Acceptable Use  
You agree not to copy, modify, reverse engineer, or create derivative works of the App; bypass security or access controls; misuse maps or geocoding or send unlawful or harmful content; interfere with the App; or violate third-party terms that apply to services used within the App. This includes, but is not limited to, attempts to exploit vulnerabilities, scrape data, or circumvent rate limits.

Stored Data  
Addresses, stops, and similar records belong to the account holder or whoever supplied them. We may normalize, deduplicate, or geocode addresses to operate the service. Removing an individual account does not automatically delete data that another user still needs, but you can request deletion through in-app tools.

Your Data and Privacy  
Our Privacy Policy explains what we collect and how it is used. It forms part of these Terms. You can review, correct, or delete your account and data inside the App (password confirmation is required). When deletion is confirmed, data leaves active systems immediately and is removed from backups on the next purge cycle. The App does not capture your precise GPS location and does not serve advertising. We log sign-in times ("last active") for security and troubleshooting.

Third-Party Services  
The App relies on service providers such as database or authentication platforms, hosting and CDN services, build or delivery services, map or geocoding providers, and web-based payments. Using the App means you also accept the terms required by those services. We are not responsible for providers we do not control.

Updates and Availability  
We may update the App automatically. Features, tiers, limits, or eligibility may change or be discontinued at any time. Service may be unavailable during maintenance, outages, or events beyond our control. We may throttle, disable, or block usage that appears abusive or unsafe.

Support  
Support is provided on a reasonable-efforts basis with no guaranteed response or resolution times.

Fees  
The App offers a free tier and paid business tiers. Billing and subscription upgrades are managed on the web (including Stripe Checkout); the iOS companion does not process in-app purchases. Pricing, plans, and limits may change at any time to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Disclaimers  
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App and related services are provided "as is" and "as available," without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, or availability.

Limitation of Liability  
To the maximum extent permitted by law, MacDonald AI and its officers, employees, and agents are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages; any loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill; or any damages exceeding the greater of (a) CAD $100 in total or (b) amounts you paid to us in the three months before the claim, arising from the App or these Terms. Your sole remedy for dissatisfaction with the App is to stop using it.

Indemnity  
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless MacDonald AI from claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) that result from your use of the App, your breach of these Terms, or your violation of law or third-party rights.

Termination  
You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate access immediately if you violate these Terms, if a third-party provider requires it, or if the law demands it. Once terminated, your license ends and you must stop using the App. In-app tools let you delete your account or data.

App Store Terms  
If you downloaded the App from Apple or Google, the applicable store terms also apply, and you agree to follow them wherever they impose additional requirements.

Governing Law and Venue  
These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles. Courts located in Ottawa, Ontario have exclusive jurisdiction, and you consent to personal jurisdiction there.

Changes  
We may revise these Terms. Material updates will be communicated through reasonable notice, and continuing to use the App after changes take effect constitutes acceptance.

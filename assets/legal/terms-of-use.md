Blow-Grid — Terms of Use

Effective date: December 2, 2025  
Owner: MacDonald AI, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada  
Contact: campbell@macdonaldautomation.com

These Terms of Use (the "Terms") govern your access to and use of the Blow-Grid application and related services (the "App"). "We," "us," and "our" mean MacDonald AI. "You" means the individual or entity using the App. By installing, accessing, or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

## 1. Acceptance
Installing, accessing, or using the App means you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the App.

## 2. Eligibility
The App may be used only by individuals who receive an account or invite from an organization or administrator. You must comply with these Terms and all applicable laws. The App is not directed to children under 13, and you may not use the App if you are under 13.

## 3. Accounts and Security
You are responsible for safeguarding your login credentials and all activity that occurs under your account. You agree to provide accurate, current information and keep it up to date. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms, threaten the security, integrity, or availability of the App or its users, or otherwise appear abusive or unsafe. Developer-only tools (for example, impersonation, diagnostic tools, or account removal) are restricted to authorized developer roles.

## 4. License
We grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the App for your personal or business use, in accordance with these Terms. All other rights in and to the App are reserved by us and our licensors.

## 5. Acceptable Use
You agree that you will not:
- Copy, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works of the App (except to the extent such restrictions are prohibited by law);
- Bypass or attempt to bypass security, authentication, or access controls;
- Misuse maps, routes, or geocoding, or send unlawful, harmful, fraudulent, or abusive content through the App;
- Interfere with or disrupt the App, its infrastructure, or other users (including by attempting to exploit vulnerabilities, scrape data, or circumvent rate limits); or
- Violate third-party terms that apply to services used within the App (such as map, geocoding, hosting, or payment providers).

## 6. Stored Data
Addresses, stops, and similar records belong to the account holder or whoever supplied them. We may normalize, deduplicate, or geocode addresses to operate and improve the service. Removing an individual account does not automatically delete data that another user or organization still needs, but you can request deletion of your own account and associated data through in-app tools, subject to those shared-use constraints.

## 7. Workspace Confidentiality
You must treat all workspace data (including routes, addresses, customer information, and operational details) as confidential and use it only for the internal business purposes of the workspace that provided it. You must not export, forward, screenshot, or otherwise share workspace information outside your organization or with unauthorized recipients unless you have explicit written permission from your administrator or manager. Your use of the App does not waive or alter any confidentiality, employment, or contractor obligations you owe to your organization. Unauthorized disclosure may expose you to disciplinary action by your organization, termination of access to the App, and legal claims by your organization or us. We may suspend or disable accounts and notify the applicable administrator if we believe workspace data has been misused or shared without authorization.

## 7. Your Data and Privacy
Our Privacy Policy explains what we collect and how we use it. It forms part of these Terms. You can review, correct, or delete your account and data inside the App (password confirmation is required). When deletion is confirmed:
- Data is removed from active systems promptly; and
- Data is removed from backups on the next scheduled purge cycle.
The App requests your foreground device location (GPS) to show your current position on the map. You can deny the permission; if you do, the App will not show your location dot and some map features may be limited. The App does not serve advertising. For security and troubleshooting, we log sign-in times and similar "last active" information.

## 8. Third-Party Services
The App relies on service providers such as:
- Database or authentication platforms;
- Hosting and CDN providers;
- Build, delivery, and error-reporting services;
- Map and geocoding providers; and
- Web-based payment processors.
Using the App means you also accept any terms required by those services. We are not responsible for the acts, omissions, or availability of providers we do not control.

## 9. Updates and Availability
We may update the App automatically, including security and feature updates. Features, tiers, limits, or eligibility may change or be discontinued at any time. The App may be unavailable or degraded during maintenance, outages, or events beyond our control. We may throttle, disable, or block usage that appears abusive, unsafe, or inconsistent with these Terms.

## 10. Support
Support is provided on a reasonable-efforts basis only. We do not guarantee any particular response time, resolution time, or outcome.

## 11. Fees
The App may offer a free tier and paid business tiers. Billing and subscription upgrades are managed on the web (including via Stripe Checkout). The iOS companion app does not process in-app purchases. Pricing, plans, and limits may change at any time to the fullest extent permitted by law. Any applicable taxes are your responsibility unless we state otherwise.

## 12. Disclaimers
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App and related services are provided "as is" and "as available," without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, accuracy, reliability, completeness, or continuous availability. You use the App at your own risk.

## 13. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, MacDonald AI and its officers, employees, and agents are not liable for:
- Indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages;
- Any loss of profits, revenue, data, business, or goodwill; or
- Any damages exceeding the greater of: (a) CAD $100 in total; or (b) the amounts you paid to us for the App in the three (3) months before the claim arose,
in each case arising out of or relating to the App or these Terms, whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or any other legal theory, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Your sole and exclusive remedy for dissatisfaction with the App is to stop using it. Some jurisdictions do not allow certain exclusions or limitations; in those jurisdictions, our liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## 14. Indemnity
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless MacDonald AI and its officers, employees, and agents from and against any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to your use of the App, your breach of these Terms, or your violation of any law or third-party rights.

## 15. Termination
You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access to the App immediately, with or without notice, if you violate these Terms, if a third-party provider requires it, or if we are required to do so by law or legal process. Upon termination, your license to use the App ends and you must stop using and uninstall the App. In-app tools let you request deletion of your account or data, subject to Section 6.

## 16. App Store Terms
If you downloaded the App from Apple's App Store or Google Play: (a) the applicable store's terms also apply to your use of the App; and (b) where those store terms impose additional requirements, you agree to comply with them. Apple and Google are not responsible for providing support for the App unless required by their own terms.

## 17. Governing Law and Venue
These Terms are governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable there, without regard to conflict-of-laws principles. You agree that courts located in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute arising out of or relating to the App or these Terms, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

## 18. Changes
We may revise these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide reasonable notice (for example, in-app notice or email, where available). By continuing to use the App after the updated Terms take effect, you accept the changes. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the App.
